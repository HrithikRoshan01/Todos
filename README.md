1) Components:
a) The AddTodo component allows users to add new todo items.                                                                                                                                                        
b) The Todo component displays the list of todo items.                                                                                                                                                           
c) The App component serves as the main entry point for the application, rendering the title, the AddTodo component, and the Todo component.                                                                        

2) Redux Integration:                                                                                                                                                                             
a) Redux is used for state management.                                                                                                                                                                     
b) The todoSlice file defines a Redux slice with actions and reducers for managing todo items.                                                                                                                      
c) Redux useSelector hook is used in the App component to retrieve data from the Redux store state.                                                                                                                  
d) Redux useDispatch hook is used to dispatch actions for adding and removing todo items.

4) Styling:                                                                                  
a) Styling is applied using CSS modules and Tailwind CSS.                                                                                                                                                            
b) CSS files (App.css, AddTodo.css, Todo.css) contain styling rules for the respective components.                                                                                                                   

4) Functionality:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
a) Users can add new todo items using the input field in the AddTodo component.                                                                                                                                   
b) Added todo items are displayed dynamically in the Todo component.                                                                                                                                             
c) Users can remove todo items by clicking on a delete button associated with each item.                                                                                                                               

5) Repository Structure:                                                                                                                                                                                           a) The code is organized into components, Redux slice files, and CSS files.                                                                                                                                          
c) Each component has its own folder containing the component file and its corresponding CSS file.
